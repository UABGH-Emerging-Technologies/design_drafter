# Secrets Placeholder

This folder is intentionally kept in the repo as a placeholder for local secrets.
Do NOT commit real secrets here. Provide secrets via your environment or secure
mounts (e.g., /run/secrets or your own secret management system).

Common files you might place locally (untracked):
- api_keys.json
- azure_proxy_key
- openai_api_key
